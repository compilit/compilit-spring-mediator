# compilit-spring-mediator

An implementation of the Mediator/CQERS pattern using Spring.

This implementation was inspired by <a href="https://github.com/jkratz55/spring-mediatR">Spring MediatR</a>
and <a href=https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR>MediatR for .NET</a>.

I do not claim this is a better implementation than the aforementioned JVM implementation. Only the initial
configuration is a bit easier/less verbose.

# Installation

Get this dependency with the latest version.

```xml

<dependency>
    <artifactId>compilit-spring-mediator</artifactId>
    <groupId>com.compilit</groupId>
</dependency>
```

Then add an extra ManagedBeanScan to your project by annotating a managed bean class with @ComponentScan(
CQERS_MEDIATOR_PACKAGE). I've noticed that adding this annotation to the main class works all the time. Other managed beans might be more finicky about having this annotation.

```Java

@ComponentScan(CQERS_MEDIATOR_PACKAGE)
@SpringBootApplication
public class Launcher {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    SpringApplication.run(Launcher.class, args);
  }

}
```

Now all you need to do is register QueryHandler, CommandHandler and/or EventHandler implementations.

# Usage

The Mediator pattern is about making your application loosely
coupled. <a href="https://www.compilit.com/definitions/cqers/">CQRS</a> (or in this case CQERS) is meant to make the
application robust and predictable by separating reading operations from writing operations. Combining them is quite a
popular approach. The idea is that a Mediator is in between all requests (requests can be read or write requests), so
that is no direct interaction with resources. This means that there are only 3 specific dependencies which connect your
api layer to the domain layer: the CommandDispatcher, the QueryDispatcher and the EventEmitter. Why 3 instead of just
1 'Mediator' class? Because that would introduce the 'Service Locator antipattern' and defeat the purpose of this
library. By having a separate interface for Commands, Queries and Events, CQ(E)RS is enforced.

In the com.compilit.mediator.api package you'll find all interfaces which you can use to write your own Commands,
Queries, Events and their respective handlers.

All components which a user of the API can to interact with:

### Command-related

- <b>Command:</b> a writing operation which is handled by a single handler. It provides a return value option to return
  an Id of a created entity for example. Or you could return
  a <a href="https://github.com/compilit/compilit-results">Result</a>. This return value should never be
  filled by a reading operation.
- <b>CommandHandler:</b> the handler for a specific Command.
- <b>CommandDispatcher:</b> the main interactor for dispatching Commands.

### Query-related

- <b>Query:</b> a reading operation which is handled by a single handler.
- <b>QueryHandler:</b> the handler for a specific Query.
- <b>QueryDispatcher:</b> the main interactor for dispatching Queries.

### Event-related

- <b>Event:</b> something that has happened which other operations (EventHandlers) can subscribe to. Can be handled by multiple
  EventHandlers.
- <b>EventHandler:</b> the handler for a specific Event.
- <b>EventEmitter:</b> the main interactor for emitting Events.

Here is an example:

```java
import QueryDispatcher;

public class TestQuery implements Query<String> {

  private final String someData;

  public TestQuery(String someData) {
    this.someData = someData;
  }

  public String getData() {
    return someData;
  }
}

@ManagedBean
public class TestQueryHandler implements QueryHandler<TestQuery, String> {

  //This class could interact with other systems/clients/hibernate etc.
  @Override
  public String handle(TestQuery query) {
    return query.getData();
  }

}

@RestController
public class ExampleController {

  private final QueryDispatcher queryDispatcher;

  public ExampleController(QueryDispatcher queryDispatcher) {
    this.queryDispatcher = queryDispatcher;
  }

  @GetMapping("/some-example")
  public ResponseEntity<String> interact() {
    return queryDispatcher.dispatch(new TestQuery());
  }

}
```

### For those paying attention

If you've looked at my implementation you might have noticed that there is no difference in behaviour between the
CommandHandlers and the QueryHandlers. Both have the ability to return values. It is true that returning a value from a
Command enables the user of this library to still break with CQRS and perform reading operations inside CommandHandlers.
This, however, is always possible. I considered this and decided that it was more important to provide an API that is
consistent with other frameworks and libraries. Most writing operations return either the written object, the ID of the
written object or some other kind of result. The whole point of having a separate Query and Command class is for reading
purposes only. This way it should be clear to the reader that some operation is only about reading or about writing.
